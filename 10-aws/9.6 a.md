# **149. When will you go for EFS over EBS in real-time?**

### **Short Explanation**

Tests if you understand the difference between **shared storage (EFS)** and **block storage (EBS)** and when each should be used.

---

# **Answer**

Use **EFS** when you need **shared, scalable, multi-AZ storage** that multiple instances or pods can access at the same time.
Use **EBS** for **single-instance, high-performance block storage**.

---

# **Detailed Explanation**

EFS is ideal when storage must be **shared**, **concurrently accessed**, or needs **automatic scaling**.

Here are the real-world situations where EFS is preferred over EBS:

---

## ✅ **1. When multiple EC2/EKS pods need shared storage**

EFS is NFS-based and supports concurrent access.

**Use case examples:**

* Web servers needing shared `/var/www/html`
* EKS pods that need shared config/log folder
* Shared user uploads (images/videos)

---

## ✅ **2. When you need storage persistent across multiple AZs**

EFS is **Multi-AZ** by default.
EBS is **AZ-bound**.

Example:

```
If an EC2 in AZ-a dies, another in AZ-b can access same EFS.
```

---

## ✅ **3. When storage needs to auto-scale**

EFS grows and shrinks automatically.

EBS:

* Needs manual resizing
* Requires reboot/volume modification

---

## ✅ **4. When you want serverless/shared storage for Lambda**

EFS integrates with Lambda for large code/data processing.

Example:

* Machine learning model loading
* Large file processing

---

## ✅ **5. When you want high durability + no storage management**

EFS = 11×9 durability + no sizing.

---

## **When NOT to use EFS**

* High IOPS database workloads (EBS is better)
* Single-EC2 apps
* Low-latency disk needs

# **Summary Table**

| Feature    | EFS            | EBS          |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Access     | Multi-instance | Single EC2   |
| AZ Support | Multi-AZ       | Single AZ    |
| Scaling    | Auto           | Manual       |
| Use Case   | Shared storage | OS disk, DBs |
| Latency    | Higher         | Lower        |
| Cost       | Higher         | Lower        |

---

# **Key Takeaway**

**Choose EFS when you need shared, scalable, multi-AZ storage. Choose EBS for single-instance, low-latency workloads.**
