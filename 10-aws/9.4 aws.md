# **147. Which AWS services do you use in your day-to-day life?**

### **Short Explanation**

This tests your practical AWS exposure and whether your daily work aligns with real DevOps responsibilities.

---

# **Answer**

On a day-to-day basis, I use **EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, Lambda, RDS, EKS, CloudTrail, and Terraform** for automation, deployments, monitoring, and infrastructure management.

---

# **Detailed Explanation**

Below is a solid, realistic DevOps daily workflow answer:

---

## **1. EC2 – Server provisioning & troubleshooting**

* Launching instances
* Patch updates
* Checking CPU spikes
* Log analysis
* AMI creation
* EBS management

---

## **2. S3 – Storage & backups**

* Storing logs, artifacts
* Hosting static sites
* Lifecycle rules for cost saving
* Cross-account access
* Backup & Restore of objects

---

## **3. IAM – Access control**

* Creating/restricting users
* Defining least privilege roles
* Cross-account role setup
* Access key rotation
* Auditing policies

---

## **4. VPC & Networking – Core network setup**

* Subnets, route tables, IGW, NAT
* Security Groups
* NACL checks
* VPC Peering/TGW
* VPN/Direct Connect troubleshooting

---

## **5. CloudWatch – Monitoring & Alerts**

* Setting alarms (CPU, memory, logs)
* Log insights queries
* Dashboard creation
* Automated alerts via SNS

---

## **6. Lambda – Serverless automation**

* Cron jobs
* S3 → Lambda → DynamoDB workflows
* Automation tasks (cleanup, tagging, notifications)

---

## **7. RDS – Database operations**

* Backups & snapshots
* Storage monitoring
* Failover testing
* Parameter group changes

---

## **8. EKS / ECS – Container orchestration**

Daily tasks:

* Deployments via CI/CD
* Node scaling
* Pod troubleshooting (OOM, CrashLoopBackOff)
* ECR image management

---

## **9. CloudTrail – Governance & troubleshooting**

* Tracking resource creation/deletion
* Investigating security issues
* Auditing IAM actions

---

## **10. Terraform / CloudFormation – IaC**

* Creating infrastructure
* Running plan/apply
* Managing state
* Modularizing code

---

## **11. Cost Explorer – Cost optimization**

* Detecting unused resources
* Right-sizing instances
* Checking expensive services

---
