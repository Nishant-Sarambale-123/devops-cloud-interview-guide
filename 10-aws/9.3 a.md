# **146. Auto Scaling Group Not Launching EC2 — What can be the issue?**

### **Short explanation**

If an ASG is not launching EC2 instances, the issue is usually with the **launch template**, **subnet**, **permissions**, or **instance limits**.

---

# **Answer**

Common reasons include: **instance type not available**, **subnets with no capacity**, **failed launch template**, **invalid AMI**, **IAM role issues**, **scaling policies misconfigured**, or **reached EC2 quota limits**.

---

# **Detailed explanation**

When an **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** fails to launch EC2 instances, check these main areas:

---

## **1. Launch Template / Launch Configuration Issues**

### Common problems:

* **Invalid AMI ID** (AMI deleted / not shared)
* **Wrong key pair** (does not exist)
* **Unsupported instance type** in selected AZ
* **Missing IAM instance profile**

### Example:

If AMI is missing:

```
Failed: AMI ID ami-0xxxx does not exist
```

---

## **2. Subnet or Availability Zone Issues**

ASG tries to launch in the AZs/subnets you selected.

Problems:

* **Subnet has no free IPs**
* **AZ capacity issues** (“InsufficientInstanceCapacity”)
* **Subnet not mapped to the same VPC as the ASG**
* **ASG configured with only 1 AZ that is out of capacity**

**Fix:** Add more AZs or subnets.

---

## **3. Security Group or Network Issues**

* Security group not attached
* Invalid security group ID
* Subnet not having proper routing (no IGW for public instance)

---

## **4. IAM Permissions**

The **Instance Profile** attached to the EC2 must exist.

If missing → instance won't launch.

---

## **5. EC2 Quota (Limit) Issues**

### Example:

* Reached max **vCPU limit**
* Reached **EC2 instance limit** for region
* Reached **instance type limit**

Check:

```
AWS → Service Quotas → EC2 On-Demand Instance Limits
```

---

## **6. ASG Health Check / Scaling Policies**

* Desired capacity = 0
* Scaling policies incorrectly set
* Health check type mismatch (ELB vs EC2)

---

## **7. Placement Group Issue**

ASG cannot launch instances inside packed or clustered placement groups sometimes due to capacity.

---

## **8. Instance Failed Booting (User data errors)**

Instance launches then immediately terminates due to:

* Wrong user-data script
* Boot failure
* Missing packages

You can check in:

```
Auto Scaling → Activity History
EC2 → Console logs
```

# **Summary table**

| Issue Category   | Examples                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Launch Template  | Wrong AMI, wrong instance type, missing IAM role |
| Subnets          | No IPs, AZ capacity issue                        |
| EC2 Limits       | vCPU or instance limit reached                   |
| SG / Network     | SG missing, invalid subnet                       |
| Scaling Settings | Desired capacity = 0                             |
| Boot errors      | User data script failure                         |

---

# **Key takeaway**

**ASG normally fails due to launch template errors, subnet/AZ capacity issues, or EC2 quota limits—always check Activity History first.**
