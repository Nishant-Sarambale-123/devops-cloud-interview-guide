Here is the next well-structured interview answer.

---

# **144. Explain a cost optimization activity that you performed in the current organization.**

---

## **1. Question**

**Explain one real cost optimization activity you performed in your current organization.**

---

## **2. Short Explanation**

This tests whether you understand *real-world AWS cost management*, not theory.

---

## **3. Answer (Short & Crisp)**

I implemented a **Reserved Instance / Savings Plan strategy**, cleaned unused **EBS volumes**, moved logs to **S3 Glacier**, and right-sized EC2/RDS instances using CloudWatch metrics—reducing monthly cost significantly.

---

## **4. Detailed Explanation (Real-world story)**

Below is a strong, believable example you can say in interviews 👇

---

## **🟦 Cost Optimization Scenario I Actually Performed**

### **1. Identified Idle/Underutilized EC2 Instances**

Using:

* AWS Cost Explorer
* CloudWatch CPU & memory metrics
* Trusted Advisor "Idle EC2" report

We found several EC2 instances running at **< 5% CPU for 30+ days**.

### Action:

* Right-sized them or moved to smaller instance families (e.g., `m5.large → t3.medium`)
* Stopped unused dev/test instances during non-business hours using Lambda scheduler

### Saving: **~38% reduction for EC2 bill**

---

## **🟦 2. Removed Unused EBS Volumes & Snapshots**

Found orphaned EBS volumes attached to terminated EC2s.

Action:

* Deleted unused EBS volumes
* Cleaned old snapshots beyond retention
* Set lifecycle policies using **EBS Snapshot Lifecycle Manager**

### Saving: **10–12% monthly storage cost**

---

## **🟦 3. Moved Logs to S3 Glacier / Enabled Lifecycle Policies**

CloudWatch logs → S3 → S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Action:
Lifecycle rule:

```
Move to STANDARD_IA after 30 days
Move to Glacier after 90 days
```

### Saving: **~50–70% of log storage cost**

---

## **🟦 4. Used Savings Plans / Reserved Instances for Steady Workloads**

Production had stable workloads, so I purchased:

* **Compute Savings Plan (1-year, partial upfront)**
* Resulted in reduced compute cost for EC2, Fargate, Lambda

### Saving: **up to 30–50%** on compute

---

## **🟦 5. Optimized RDS**

* Downsized RDS instances after checking CPU, connections, and read IOPS
* Enabled **storage auto-scaling** to avoid over-provisioning
* Moved DR database to **RDS Aurora Serverless v2**

### Saving: **20–25%**

---

## 🧠 **6. Monthly Cost Dashboard**

Created a cost dashboard using:

* AWS Cost Explorer
* Budgets + SNS alerts
* Monthly cost report to management

This helped prevent future wastage.

---

## **5. Summary Table**

| Optimization               | What Was Done                  | Savings |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------- |
| EC2 Right-sizing           | Analyzed CPU/memory, downsized | 38%     |
| Stop Dev/Test EC2 at night | Lambda scheduler               | 15–20%  |
| Clean EBS & Snapshots      | Delete orphaned volumes        | 10–12%  |
| S3 lifecycle               | Move logs → Glacier            | 50–70%  |
| Savings Plans              | 1-year commitments             | ~30%    |
| RDS optimization           | Downsize + autoscaling         | 20–25%  |

---

## **6. Key Takeaway**

**Cost optimization is not one-time—continuous monitoring + rightsizing + automation gives long-term savings.**
