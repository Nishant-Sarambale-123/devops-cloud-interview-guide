# **159. What is the difference between IAM User & IAM Role?**

## **Short Explanation:**

Tests your understanding of AWS identity, access management, and cross-account access.

---

## **Answer:**

An **IAM User** is a **permanent identity** with long-term credentials (password, access keys).
An **IAM Role** is a **temporary identity** that AWS services or users can **assume** to get temporary permissions.

---

## **Detailed Explanation**

## **1. IAM User**

A user represents:

* A real person (developer/admin)
* Has long-term credentials
* Can log in to AWS Console
* Can generate Access Key/Secret Key

IAM Users have:

* MFA
* Password policies
* Permanent identity

Use cases:

* Developers
* Admin users
* Human access requiring console login

---

## **2. IAM Role**

A role is:

* Not tied to a specific user
* Does **not** have permanent credentials
* Uses **STS temporary tokens**
* Can be assumed by:

  * IAM users
  * AWS services (Lambda, EC2, ECS)
  * External accounts

Use cases:

* EC2 instance accessing S3
* Lambda writing to DynamoDB
* Cross-account access
* Temporary admin access

Example:
EC2 Role that allows EC2 to access S3 → no access keys required.

---

## **3. How IAM Role Works**

Flow:

1. User/service **assumes** the role
2. AWS STS issues **temporary credentials**
3. Permissions last for minutes/hours
4. Credentials automatically expire

This increases security and eliminates static keys.

---

## **4. Trust Policy (Critical Difference)**

IAM role has **two policies**:

1. **Permissions Policy** → what role can do
2. **Trust Policy** → who can assume the role

Example trust policy:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": { "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com" },
  "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
}
```

## **5. Security Comparison**

| Feature               | IAM User | IAM Role             |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| Long-term credentials | Yes      | No                   |
| Temporary credentials | No       | Yes (STS)            |
| Used by               | Humans   | AWS services / users |
| Console login         | Yes      | No                   |
| Cross-account         | Hard     | Easy                 |
| Rotation required     | Yes      | No (automatic)       |

---

## **6. Real Example From DevOps**

**Bad practice:** EC2 using access keys manually stored inside environment
**Good practice:** Attach **IAM Role** to EC2 → automatically provides temporary credentials.

---

## **7. When to Use What**

### **Use IAM User when:**

* A person needs AWS Console login
* Long-term human access is required

### **Use IAM Role when:**

* AWS services need permissions
* You need cross-account access
* You want temporary privileges
* You want to eliminate access keys

---

## **Summary Table**

| Aspect        | IAM User               | IAM Role                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Identity type | Permanent              | Temporary                     |
| Credentials   | Password + Access Keys | STS (Temporary Keys)          |
| Who uses it   | Humans                 | AWS Services / Other Accounts |
| Console login | Yes                    | No                            |
| Use case      | Dev/Admin login        | EC2, Lambda, STS assume role  |

---

## **Key Takeaway:**

**IAM User = human identity; IAM Role = temporary permissions for AWS services or cross-account access.**
