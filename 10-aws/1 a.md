Let’s start with **Question 135** 👇

---

### **135. Explain how will you design a highly available and scalable multi-tier app.**

**Short Explanation:**
This question checks your understanding of **AWS architecture design** — focusing on **high availability (HA)**, **scalability**, and **fault tolerance** across tiers (web, application, database).

---

**Answer:**
A highly available and scalable multi-tier app can be designed using **VPC**, **Elastic Load Balancer**, **Auto Scaling Groups**, **RDS Multi-AZ**, and **S3/CloudFront** for static content. Each layer is deployed across **multiple Availability Zones** for redundancy.

---

**Detailed Explanation:**
A typical **3-tier architecture** includes:

1. **Presentation Layer (Web Tier):**

   * Deploy web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache) in **public subnets**.
   * Use an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances in **different AZs**.
   * Use **Route 53** for DNS-based load balancing and health checks.

2. **Application Layer (App Tier):**

   * Place app servers in **private subnets**.
   * Attach them to **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** for automatic scaling based on CPU/memory usage.
   * Allow inbound traffic only from the ALB (via security groups).

3. **Database Layer (DB Tier):**

   * Use **Amazon RDS** (MySQL/PostgreSQL) in **Multi-AZ** mode for HA.
   * Enable **read replicas** for scaling read-heavy workloads.
   * Store backups automatically with **RDS automated backups**.

4. **Storage & Caching:**

   * Store static content (images, CSS, JS) in **S3**, and deliver via **CloudFront CDN**.
   * Use **ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached)** for faster data access.

5. **Networking:**

   * Use **NAT Gateway** for private subnets to access the Internet for updates.
   * Use **VPC Flow Logs**, **CloudWatch**, and **CloudTrail** for monitoring.

6. **Security:**

   * Apply **Security Groups** (stateful) and **NACLs** (stateless) for layered protection.
   * Use **IAM roles** instead of access keys.

**Summary Table:**

| Layer          | AWS Service                    | HA/Scalability Feature  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Web            | ALB + ASG                      | Multi-AZ load balancing |
| App            | EC2 + ASG                      | Auto Scaling, Multi-AZ  |
| DB             | RDS (Multi-AZ + Read Replicas) | Automatic failover      |
| Caching        | ElastiCache                    | In-memory scaling       |
| Static content | S3 + CloudFront                | Global delivery         |
| Security       | SG, NACL, IAM                  | Layered protection      |

---

**Key Takeaway:**
Always design across **multiple AZs** with **load balancing and auto scaling** — that’s the foundation of a **highly available and scalable AWS architecture**.
