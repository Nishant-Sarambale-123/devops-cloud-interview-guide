# **150. How do you disable AWS Console access for IAM Users?**

### **Short Explanation**

Tests IAM access control knowledge and how to enforce least-privilege + security.

---

# **Answer**

Remove their **console password**, enforce **access key only**, and optionally apply an **IAM policy** that denies console login.

---

# **Detailed Explanation**

There are **three correct and industry-accepted ways** to disable console access for IAM users.

---

# **Method 1: Remove the IAM User's Console Password (Most Common)**

Steps:

1. Go to **IAM → Users → Security Credentials**
2. Under *Console access* → click **Disable**
3. This removes the password → user cannot log in to console anymore.

✔ API/CLI access still works
✖ All console access blocked

---

# **Method 2: Apply Explicit Deny Policy for ConsoleLogin**

Attach this policy to the IAM user:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "iam:ChangePassword",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "sts:GetFederationToken",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This blocks the ability to authenticate interactively.

---

# **Method 3: Delete or Disable MFA + Blocked Password Policy**

If you want CLI only:

* Disable password login
* Enforce key-based programmatic access only

---

# **Extra: Block Console Access for Entire Org (Best Practice)**

Using IAM SCP:

```
Deny access to console except for Admin OU
```

Using AWS Organizations:

* Create SCP that denies `aws-portal:*` or `signin:*`

# **Summary Table**

| Method               | Blocks Console? | Blocks CLI? | Notes                |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| Remove password      | Yes             | No          | Most common + safest |
| Explicit Deny Policy | Yes             | No          | Used in enterprise   |
| SCP                  | Yes             | Optional    | Org-level control    |

---

# **Key Takeaway**

**Disable console access by removing the IAM user’s password — the simplest and most secure method.**
