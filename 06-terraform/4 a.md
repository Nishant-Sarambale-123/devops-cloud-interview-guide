Here is **Question 69**, in your exact interview format.

# ✅ **69. Have you considered storing the statefile in Git instead of AWS S3 or Azure Blob?**

### **1. Question**

Have you considered storing the Terraform statefile in Git instead of S3 or Azure Blob?

---

### **2. Short explanation**

Storing statefiles in Git is unsafe because it exposes secrets, causes merge conflicts, and does not support locking.

---

### **3. Answer**

No, storing the statefile in Git is not recommended. Statefiles contain sensitive data and do not support locking, which can cause corruption if multiple people update the state at the same time. Instead, remote backends like S3 with DynamoDB, Azure Blob, GCS, or Terraform Cloud provide encryption, versioning, access control, and safe state locking.

---

### **4. Detailed explanation**

Git is designed for **version control**, not **state management**. Terraform statefiles contain sensitive data and change frequently, so Git is the worst place to store them.

---

## ❌ **Why storing Terraform statefile in Git is a bad idea**

### **1. Statefile contains secrets**

State includes:

* IAM credentials
* Passwords
* Tokens
* User data
* Resource metadata

These can be exposed to anyone who has repo access.

---

### **2. No locking → high chance of corruption**

If two DevOps Engineers push changes at the same time:

* Merge conflicts
* Broken state
* Stale references
* Unexpected resource destruction

Git **cannot** lock files, but backends like DynamoDB & Terraform Cloud can.

---

### **3. Merge conflicts break state**

Statefiles are JSON and very large.
A conflict may:

* Break the state format
* Cause Terraform to recreate resources
* Lead to production outages

---

### **4. Statefile grows large and spammy**

Every run may update the tfstate, creating huge noisy commits.

---

### **5. Security compliance issues**

Secrets in Git violate:

* SOC2
* ISO
* GDPR
* Cloud provider security best practices

---

## ✔️ **Preferred storage options**

| Backend                        | Features                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **AWS S3 + DynamoDB**          | Encryption, locking, versioning      |
| **Azure Blob**                 | Encryption, RBAC                     |
| **GCS (Google Cloud Storage)** | IAM-based access                     |
| **Terraform Cloud/Enterprise** | Secure, locking, UI, drift detection |

These provide:

* State locking
* Encryption
* Access control
* Automatic versioning

---

### **5. Summary table**

| Aspect          | Git     | S3 / Azure Blob / Terraform Cloud |
| --------------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| Locking         | ❌ No    | ✔️ Yes                            |
| Secrets safe?   | ❌ No    | ✔️ Encrypted                      |
| Merge conflicts | ❌ Yes   | ✔️ No                             |
| Best practice   | ❌ Avoid | ✔️ Recommended                    |

### **6. Key takeaway**

**Statefile should never be stored in Git — use a remote backend with locking and encryption.**
