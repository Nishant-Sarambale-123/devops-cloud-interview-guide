Here is **Question 72** in your required format.

# **72. We don’t have a cloud account. Where can we store the statefile?**

---

## **1. Question**

**We don’t have a cloud account. Where can we store the Terraform statefile?**

---

## **2. Short explanation**

You can store the statefile locally or use non-cloud remote backends like Git, local filesystem, Terraform Enterprise, or open-source tools.

---

## **3. Answer**

If you don’t have a cloud account, Terraform state can be stored in **local backend**, **Git repository** (with caution), **self-hosted storage**, **Terraform Enterprise**, **MinIO**, or **Consul**. The best options are **local backend** for learning and **self-hosted MinIO/Consul** for teams.

---

## **4. Detailed explanation**

Terraform needs a statefile (`terraform.tfstate`) to track resources.
If you don’t have AWS/Azure/GCP accounts, you can still store state using these methods:

---

### **A) Local Backend (Default)**

Terraform stores the state **on your local machine** in the project folder.

```
terraform.tfstate
```

Best for:

* Learning
* Single-developer usage

Not good for:

* Teams
* State locking

---

### **B) Store Statefile in Git (Not recommended in real projects)**

You **can** push `terraform.tfstate` to Git, but it is **not secure**.

Risks:

* Sensitive data exposure
* No state locking
* Merge conflicts

To store safely in Git:

* Encrypt state with **git-crypt** or **SOPS**
* Add `.terraform.lock.hcl` only, **not** the statefile

Still, this is only for training/labs.

---

### **C) Self-Hosted MinIO (S3-compatible)**

If you cannot use AWS S3, run **MinIO locally or on-prem** (Docker container).

Terraform backend config:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "mybucket"
    key    = "state/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
    endpoint = "http://localhost:9000"
    skip_credentials_validation = true
    skip_region_validation = true
  }
}
```

Supports:

* State locking
* Versioning
* Multiple developers

---

### **D) Self-Hosted Consul**

You can run **Consul** on a VM or Docker and use it as backend.

Example:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "consul" {
    address = "localhost:8500"
    path    = "terraform/state"
  }
}
```

Supports:

* State locking
* Distributed storage
* Multi-user support

---

### **E) Terraform Enterprise / Terraform Cloud (Free Tier)**

You can use **Terraform Cloud** even without any cloud provider.

Benefits:

* Remote state storage
* State locking
* Versioning
* Web UI

---

### **F) Local network file system (NFS / SMB)**

Store `terraform.tfstate` on:

* Shared network drive
* On-prem NAS

Not ideal but possible for small teams.

## **5. Summary Table**

| Storage Option   | Cloud Needed? | Locking | Secure?     | Best For              |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Local Backend    | ❌ No          | ❌ No    | ⚠️ Medium   | Learning / single dev |
| Git Repo         | ❌ No          | ❌ No    | ❌ Poor      | Demos / labs          |
| MinIO            | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes   | ✅ Good      | Teams without cloud   |
| Consul           | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes   | ✅ Good      | Production on-prem    |
| Terraform Cloud  | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes   | ✅ Excellent | Teams / collab        |
| NFS File Storage | ❌ No          | ❌ No    | ⚠️ Medium   | Small internal teams  |

---

## **6. Key takeaway**

👉 **Without cloud accounts, the best and safest Terraform state storage options are MinIO, Consul, or Terraform Cloud free tier.**
