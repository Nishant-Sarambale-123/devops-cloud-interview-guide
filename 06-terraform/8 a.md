Here is **Question 73** in your required format.

# **73. Do you use Terraform Enterprise or Community version?**

---

## **1. Question**

**Do you use Terraform Enterprise or Community version?**

---

## **2. Short explanation**

Terraform Enterprise is a paid, full-featured version for large organizations; the Community (Open-Source) version is free and widely used for normal DevOps workflows.

---

## **3. Answer**

I use the **Terraform Community (Open-Source) version** for most projects because it is sufficient for provisioning cloud infrastructure, supports modules, remote backends, CI/CD integration, and versioning.
Terraform Enterprise is mainly used by large enterprises that need features like policy-as-code, private registries, RBAC, SSO, and audit logs.

---

## **4. Detailed explanation**

Terraform comes in two primary editions:

---

## **A) Terraform Community (Open-Source) Version**

This is the most commonly used version.

### **Features**

* Free to use
* Full CLI functionality
* Supports all cloud providers
* Integrates with CI/CD
* Allows remote backends (S3, GCS, Azure Blob, etc.)
* Modules and workspaces
* Version control compatibility

### **When I use it**

* Day-to-day AWS/GCP/Azure provisioning
* Kubernetes cluster setup
* VPC, EC2, IAM, S3, RDS creation
* CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions / Jenkins)

Most companies using Terraform in a DevOps role are using **Community edition**.

---

## **B) Terraform Enterprise**

Paid, Self-hosted version used by large companies.

### **Key features**

* Private module registry
* SSO (Okta, Azure AD)
* RBAC (role based access)
* Sentinel policy as code
* Cost estimation
* Team access controls
* Detailed audit logs
* Self-hosted workspace management

### **When companies choose Enterprise**

* Strict compliance requirements
* Large teams managing shared infrastructure
* Need for advanced security & governance
* Centralized module management

---

## **C) Terraform Cloud (Free + Paid tiers)**

This is a middle ground between open-source and enterprise.

### **Free tier features**

* Remote state storage
* State locking
* Versioning
* UI to manage runs

I use this occasionally for teams that want remote state without paying for Enterprise.
