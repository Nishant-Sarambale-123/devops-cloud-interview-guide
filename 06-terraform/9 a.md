# **74. Have you heard about OpenTofu? Do you think it is better than Terraform?**

## **1. Question**

**Have you heard about OpenTofu? Do you think it is better than Terraform?**

---

## **2. Short explanation**

OpenTofu is a fully open-source fork of Terraform created after HashiCorp changed Terraform’s license. It is community-driven and aims to remain open and compatible.

---

## **3. Answer**

Yes, I have worked with OpenTofu. It is a community-driven, fully open-source fork of Terraform.
For many use cases, OpenTofu is **equal or better** than Terraform because it remains 100% open-source, supports the same syntax, has faster updates, and is backed by the Linux Foundation.
Many organizations are migrating from Terraform to OpenTofu due to licensing concerns.

---

## **4. Detailed explanation**

### **Why OpenTofu was created**

* In 2023, HashiCorp changed Terraform’s license from **MPL 2.0 (open-source)** to **BUSL (Business Source License)**.
* This restricted full open-source usage, especially for vendors and large organizations.
* The community (including Gruntwork, Spacelift, Scalr, etc.) created **OpenTofu**, which remains **fully open-source** under **MPL 2.0**.

---

## **Key Differences Between OpenTofu and Terraform**

### **A) Licensing**

* **Terraform** → BUSL (restricted open-source)
* **OpenTofu** → MPL 2.0 (truly open-source)

### **B) Community Support**

* OpenTofu is part of the **Linux Foundation**
* Contributions are transparent
* Backed by many major IaC vendors

### **C) Features**

OpenTofu started as a drop-in replacement for Terraform but is adding improvements like:

1. **State encryption at rest**
2. **State signing**
3. **More backend support**
4. **Faster bug fixes and feature releases**

---

## **Migration from Terraform to OpenTofu**

The migration is very easy:

### Step 1: Replace binary

Rename:

```
terraform → tofu
```

### Step 2: Change CLI commands

```
tofu init
tofu plan
tofu apply
```

### Step 3: No change in HCL code

Your Terraform code, modules, providers, and variables work the same.
