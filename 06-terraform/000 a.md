Here is the **perfect interview-ready answer**.

# **❓ What if you create a resource manually in AWS, and then run `terraform apply`? What happens to drift?**

---

## **Short Answer**

Terraform does **not automatically detect manually created resources** unless you **import** them.
Terraform will **not manage** or **delete** manually created resources — but it will cause **drift**, meaning your actual infrastructure and the Terraform state become out of sync.

---

## **Detailed Explanation**

### ✔️ **1. Terraform only knows about resources in the state file**

When you manually create something in AWS (for example: EC2, S3, IAM role), Terraform **does not know** it exists.

Terraform’s behavior depends on your code:

---

# **Case 1: Resource exists in AWS but NOT in Terraform code**

### Example

You manually create an EC2 instance in AWS console.

Terraform code does **not** contain an `aws_instance` block.

### What happens when you run:

```
terraform apply
```

### ➤ **Result**

Terraform does **nothing**.

Because:

* It sees no resource in code → no resource to manage
* It sees no resource in state → no change needed

### **Drift point**

Drift **exists**, but Terraform **can’t detect it** — unless you write code for it or import it.

---

# **Case 2: Resource exists in Terraform code but was created manually**

### Example

You have this in Terraform:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "demo" {
  bucket = "demo-bucket-12345"
}
```

But instead of using Terraform, you created the bucket manually in AWS.

### What happens?

Terraform tries to **create the bucket again** because it doesn’t know you already created it manually.

### Output:

```
Error: BucketAlreadyExists: The requested bucket name is not available
```

### Reason:

Terraform expects to create it but can't because it already exists.

### How to fix:

```
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.demo demo-bucket-12345
```

---

# **Case 3: Terraform-managed resource is changed manually → REAL DRIFT**

### Example

Terraform created an EC2 instance with type `t2.micro`.

You manually change it to `t2.small` in AWS console.

### What happens when you run:

```
terraform plan
```

Terraform detects drift:

```
~ instance_type = "t2.micro" -> "t2.small"
```

### What happens on apply?

Terraform will bring AWS **back to Terraform’s desired configuration**:

```
Terraform will update instance_type back to "t2.micro"
```

### ✔ Terraform always tries to enforce what is in the code

AWS console changes are overwritten.

---

# **So how to handle manually created resources?**

### Option 1 → Import into Terraform

```
terraform import aws_instance.web i-0abcd1234
```

### Option 2 → Delete manually created infra and let Terraform create it

Good for dev/staging.

### Option 3 → Stop manual changes & enforce IaC only

Use IAM restrictions + GitOps.

---

# **Drift Tools**

To detect drift early:

* **Terraform plan (CI/CD pipeline)**
* **Driftctl**
* **AWS Config**
* **Spacelift drift detection**
* **Atlantis/ArgoCD with policy checks**

---

# **Key Takeaway**

👉 **Terraform does not automatically detect manually created resources. If the resource exists outside Terraform, it causes drift, errors, or mismatches. To fix it, you must import the resource or recreate it through Terraform.**
