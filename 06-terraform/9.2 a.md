# **76. What is the difference between Resource and Datasource in Terraform?**

## **1. Question**

**What is the difference between a Resource and a Datasource in Terraform?**

---

## **2. Short explanation**

A **resource** creates or modifies infrastructure.
A **data source** reads or fetches existing infrastructure.

---

## **3. Answer**

A **resource** block (`resource`) is used to **create, update, or delete** cloud infrastructure.
A **data source** block (`data`) is used to **fetch existing information** from the cloud without creating anything.

Resources change real infrastructure; datasources only read it.

---

## **4. Detailed explanation**

Terraform uses **two main block types** when interacting with infrastructure:

---

# **A) Resource**

### **Purpose:**

Create, modify, or delete infrastructure on cloud providers.

### **Examples of resources:**

* EC2 instance
* S3 bucket
* IAM user
* VPC
* RDS DB instance

### **Example: Resource block**

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "demo" {
  bucket = "my-demo-bucket"
}
```

This actually **creates a bucket** in AWS.

---

# **B) Data Source**

### **Purpose:**

Read or reference **existing** infrastructure.

A data source never creates anything.

### **When to use data sources:**

* Fetch existing AMI ID
* Get VPC ID created outside Terraform
* Read security group details
* Lookup S3 bucket ARNs
* Lookup subnet IDs

### **Example: Data Source block**

```hcl
data "aws_ami" "latest_amazon_linux" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["amazon"]
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*"]
  }
}
```

This **only fetches AMI ID**, no creation happens.

---

# **Putting Both Together**

### Example: use Data Source in a Resource

```hcl
data "aws_ami" "latest" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["amazon"]
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.latest.id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

## **5. Summary Table**

| Feature         | Resource                   | Data Source             |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Purpose         | Create/update/delete infra | Read existing infra     |
| Keyword         | `resource`                 | `data`                  |
| Causes changes? | ✔ Yes                      | ❌ No                    |
| Example         | Create EC2, S3, VPC        | Fetch AMI, VPC, SG info |
| In Statefile?   | Yes                        | Yes (read-only)         |
| Plan output     | Shows changes              | Shows read-only fetch   |

## **6. Key takeaway**

👉 **Resources modify infra, Data sources only read infra.**
